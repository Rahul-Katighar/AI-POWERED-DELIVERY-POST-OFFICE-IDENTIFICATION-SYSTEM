## 📮 AI-Powered Delivery Post Office Identification System
📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to resolve one of the most common challenges faced in postal logistics: the incorrect or incomplete specification of addresses and PIN codes. India’s vast and dynamically evolving postal network, with over 165,000 post offices and nearly 19,000 PIN codes, often suffers from misrouting, delivery delays, and human errors.

This intelligent system automates the identification of the correct Delivery Post Office based on user-input addresses, even when the PIN code is missing, invalid, or mismatched. It also integrates with internal operational changes like merged or reassigned PIN codes, providing a highly reliable, scalable, and efficient solution.

## 🎯 Key Features
🔍 AI-Based Address Parsing
Automatically extracts city, district, locality, and landmarks from unstructured address input using NLP techniques.

🧠 PIN Code Prediction Model
Predicts the most likely PIN code based on historical postal datasets and address patterns using supervised machine learning.

✅ PIN Validation and Correction
Cross-validates user-input PIN codes against parsed addresses to suggest corrections or flag mismatches.

🧭 Routing Optimization (Optional Extension)
Suggests the best route or delivery center for dispatch using geographic mapping.

💻 User Interface Built with Streamlit
Interactive and intuitive web interface for users to input addresses and get predictions/validation results instantly.


## 🧠 AI & ML Techniques Used
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for address parsing

Decision Trees / Random Forests / XGBoost for PIN prediction

Feature engineering for location-based address fields

Confidence score estimation based on model probability

(Optional) Integration with geolocation libraries for route visualization
